# Coursera-Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
This is the course project for Getting-and-Cleaning-Data.
Please make sure that you already downloaded the required data files for this project before you using analysis script "run_analysis.R".
The analysis script run_analysis.R does the following:
1. Loads the activities and features information.
2. Loads the activity and subject data for each dataset.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in step 2.
4. Loads both the training and test datasets and merge them together.
5. Uses descriptive features to name the variable in the data set
6. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
7. Combine the data set in step 3 with the data set in step 6.
8. Combine the subjects data with the the data set in step 7.
9. Converts the activity and subject columns into factors.
10. Creates a tidy dataset that consists of the average (mean) value of each variable for each subject and activity pair.
11. Export the data set in step 10 to text file.
