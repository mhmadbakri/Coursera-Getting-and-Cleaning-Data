# Coursera-Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
#This is the course project for Getting-and-Cleaning-Data.
#Please make sure that you already downloaded the required data files for this project before you using analysis script "run_analysis.R".
#The analysis script run_analysis.R does the following:
#1- Read the activities and features information.
#2- Loads both the training and test datasets, keeping only those columns which reflect a mean or standard deviation.
#3- Loads the activity and subject data for each dataset, and merges those columns with the dataset
#4- Merges the two datasets
#5- Converts the activity and subject columns into factors
#6- Creates a tidy dataset that consists of the average (mean) value of each variable for each subject and activity pair.
